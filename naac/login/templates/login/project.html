		R Sankar Memorial SNDP Yogam Arts and Science College which is affiliated to the
University of Calicut follows the syllabi that are prescribed by the University. For the
effective implementation of the curriculum the staff council prepares an academic
calendar based on the University syllabi. The institution adopts a well-designed action
plan for the successful delivery of the curriculum.
An Academic Committee consisting of all heads of the departments with a teacher as
Convener, and the Principal as Chairman, is constituted for curriculum implementation
and monitoring. The academic committee with the support of IQAC monitors and ensures
quality in all the activities of the College. An Orientation Programme is conducted every
year for the newly admitted students to give them awareness about the academic system
of the College.
Regular Department meetings are convened by the HODs to discuss the topics to be
imparted by the faculty within the stipulated time and also to monitor the teaching
learning activity. Various Programmes like the Bridge Course, Remedial Coaching,
Walk With Scholar Programme (for advanced learners), Scholar Support
Programme (for slow learners) etc. are conducted by each Department.Special
Classes are also arranged to compensate for the lost working hours, if any.
A very effective Mentoring System functions in our College. As a part of the
programme every student in a class is under a tutor, who acts as a mentor. A tutorial
class consists of 32 students and the tutors convene the meeting of their wards in the
beginning of each semester to give proper instruction and guidance to the students in
their academic and non-academic matters.Handbooks are issued to the teachers to

record attendance and progress of their wards and to keep a note of the portions
covered.
Continuous Evaluation System plays a vital role in the proper monitoring of the
students. Two class tests and a model examination are conducted in each semester to
study the progress of the students. Internal marks are awarded to the students based on
their performance in the examinations, attendance, submission of
assignments and presentation of seminar papers. Attendance and Progress are
monitored and the parents are informed of their ward’s performance and attendance
regularly by phone or by post. PTA plays a vital role in assisting the teaching faculty in
the teaching learning process through the conduct of regular PTA meetings. The
Institution also implements a feedback system for the staff and students for mutual
improvement and rectification.
ICT enabled Teaching is implemented to make the delivery of curriculum more
interesting and effective for students. ‘Moodle’ is introduced as a free and open source
of online educational platform to enhance learning. The College has a good library with
internet facility for the benefit of the staff and students. MoU with certain colleges are
sanctioned to exchange faculty between colleges to ensure innovative and creative
curriculum delivery. Apart from these, teachers are also given sufficient freedom to
supplement university syllabus.
